# Overview

A spring boot project to track books using Apache Cassandra and OpenLibrary book database. One part of the app allows us to easily load the datasets to the Apache Cassandra (Datastax Astra) NoSQL database, the other app is the actual application which helps user to rate any book (present in the test database), and track its reading done by them and also view any book in the world. The users can track the books by marking the start & completion dates, marking the status of reading and give ratings to books. The application features are enabled and protected via GitHub OAuth login.
